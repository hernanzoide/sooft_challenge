# SOOFT Challenge
Challenge for SOOFT

## Assumptions

1- Assumed we will handle a decent amount of transfers per company. Main reason for using the Query in the repo instead of just using Streams to get all transfers and handle with code.

2- I could have added a @RestControllerAdvise to handle 500 in my API. I didn't just to keep the scope of this challenge and avoid having to add more unit/integration tests

3- I added some basic integration tests just for fun, since they were not required. Many scenarios are not covered, I know.
